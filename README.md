# Renewable vs Nuclear Energy Usage — Trend Analysis (1965–2019)

## Overview
This project analyzes **global energy consumption patterns** from 1965 to 2019, focusing on the shift from fossil fuels to renewable and nuclear energy sources. Using a combination of **Tableau**, **Power BI**, **Python**, and **R**, we explored historical trends, CO₂ emissions, and regional variations, while building interactive dashboards and predictive insights.

The goal is to highlight whether the world is moving toward cleaner energy and to provide visual insights that can inform policy and investment decisions.

## Objectives
1. Analyze how countries consume different energy sources (coal, gas, hydro, nuclear, renewables).
2. Identify global trends in fossil fuel vs renewable energy usage over 50+ years.
3. Compare continent-level consumption patterns.
4. Measure CO₂ emissions associated with energy sources.
5. Forecast future fossil fuel usage.

## Key Insights
- Fossil fuels have remained dominant but renewables have gained significant growth since 2000.
- Hydro power is still the largest renewable contributor, but solar and wind show the fastest growth rates.
- Countries with higher renewable adoption show slower CO₂ emission growth.
- Projections suggest fossil fuels will remain in use through 2030 but at a declining share.
